3) function name --> first letter small and join with camel case



4 pillars of oops
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) encapsulation
    1) data hiding
        access specifiers
            public
            private
            protected
    2) data binding
        1) static binding
            : binding the data at compile time
        2) dynamic binding
            : binding the data at run time
    3) data abstraction

    4) data encapsulation
        :class and object ,method and function, variable and data member
        constructor and destructor

class: class is a collection of objects, data member and member function, class is a blue print of object

object: object is a real time entity, 
object is a instance of class, object is a run time entity

class    object 

Fruit     apple    applle is fruit and fruit has apple
Vehicle   car      car is Vehicle and Vehicle has car

School    student  
Shose      Nike


: class keyword.. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) abstraction
    1) abstract class
    2) abstract method
    3) interface
    
3) inheritance
    1) single inheritance
    2) multilevel inheritance
    3) multiple inheritance
    4) hybrid inheritance
    5) hierarchical inheritance

4) polymorphism        
    1) compile time polymorphism
        1) function overloading
        2) operator overloading
    2) run time polymorphism
        1) function overriding
        2) virtual function
